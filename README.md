# ClariseTG's Homepage
This is the git repo for the homepage that will hopefully one day be up at [clarisetg.netlify.app](clarisetg.netlify.app)! I'm using it to get a bit more experience with HTML, CSS, and possibly even Rust webapps that I can use for more ambitious later projects.

## Wanna snoop around?
Download the whole .zip of the repo and open index.html in a browser of choice. I reccommend Firefox!
